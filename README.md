# Project SMP's Modpack
Client-sided modpack for Project: SMP server that focuses on expanding the game in ways that aren't possible through Spigot API.

#### Current features:
  ➕*Bedrock parity features, like bridging, GUI changes, etc.*
   
  ➕ *Client performance improvements (built on top of Sodium and Iris)*
  
  ➕ *World ambience, like sounds of wind blowing every now and then*
  
  ➕ *Ragdoll mobs, ragdoll block particles*
  
  ➕ *Ambient lights, like actually bright stars, eyes in the dark (purely cosmetic!), fireflies...*
  
  ➕ *Dynamic lights (you heard that right, with no OptiFine)*
  
  ➕ *Fishing improvements in form of automatic recasts (meaning that you can make an AFK farm anywhere)*
  
  ➕ ***CAPES!** Yes, actual capes visible to everyone who has the modpack!*
  
  ➕ *Drastic improvements to the Resource Pack loading (it took the time needed to load it from 30 seconds to 3 for me!)*
  
  ➕ *Ability to take high resolution screenshots using F9*
  
  ➕ *Ability to sort inventories using MMB*
  
  ➕ *Crash fixes! If a game crashes you are taken to the main menu instead!*
  
  ➕ *You actually can be set on Soul Fire (small, but decent detail)*
  
  ➕ *Sound physics, meaning reverb and echo effect in caves, etc.*
  
  ➕ *Minimap (do I need to explain this one?)*
